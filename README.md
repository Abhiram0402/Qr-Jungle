# Qr-Jungle
An amazing project for generating the coolest QR Codes!


Note: A lot of third-party APIs are used for the generation of QR Codes but are not uploaded here for security reasons. REST APIs are also excluded for security concerns. The files are combined into a single file for better readability. The authorization code part is also excluded as it contains sensitive information about my Cognito user pool and SES identities.

Includes both BMS (Business Management System) and user portals and apps. The portal can be accessed at qrjungle.com. We are almost there and are adding the coolest QR features for this platform. The project is also under further improvements to enhance user experience and functionality.
